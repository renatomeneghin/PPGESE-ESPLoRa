## Template

This repository is designed to be used as a template repository - so you can
specify this as the template repository type when creating a new repository on
GitHub.

### Use within a Private Repository

If you are using this template in a private repository, there are a couple of
additional steps you will need to take:

- Update the
  [./.github/workflows/static_analysis.yml](./.github/workflows/static_analysis.yml).
  If you are using this in a private repository, you'll need to update the `on:
  pull_request_target: ...` section to instead just be `on: [pull_request]`, otherwise
  the action won't be able to properly run.

### Additional Dependencies

- Add additional component dependencies you may want, e.g.:

  ```console
  idf.py add-dependency "espp/timer>=1.0"
  ```

## Development

If you wish to modify / recompile the code, you will need to set up your
development environment to be able to build and flash your target hardware.

### Environment

This project is an ESP-IDF project, currently [ESP-IDF
v.5.5.1 or v6.0.0](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

For information about setting up `ESP-IDF`, please see [the official
ESP-IDF getting started
documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v6.0/esp32s3/get-started/index.html).

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Contributing

If you're developing code to contribute to this repository, it's recommended to
configure your development environment:

### Code style

1. Ensure `clang-format` is installed
2. Ensure [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) is installed
3. Set up `pre-commit` for this repository:

  ``` console
  pre-commit install
  ```

This helps ensure that consistent code formatting is applied, by running
`clang-format` each time you change the code (via a git pre-commit hook) using
the [./.clang-format](./.clang-format) code style configuration file.

If you ever want to re-run the code formatting on all files in the repository,
you can do so:

``` console
pre-commit run --all-files
```
